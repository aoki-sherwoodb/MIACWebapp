DATA: Results from the 2009-2019 MIAC men's cross country championships

	Data obtained from the Men's Cross Country Archives
	on the MIAC website, https://www.miacathletics.com/sports/mxc/archives

STATUS: All of our functionalities should be working properly, including all three graphing
	analyses for all combinations of years and teams. Note that athlete development requires
	multiple years for the analysis; our app response reflects this.
	Also note that because of an error in the input data we scraped, some names from the
	2016 results have two spaces between the first and last names, causing these runners
	to have two entries in search results.

NOTES: we didn't factor accessibility into account when designing
	our page layout. Also, screen resizing is a little funky and the
	page is not designed to work on phones.
	Finally, Team Spread takes a moment to load the graphs if many teams and years are included.
